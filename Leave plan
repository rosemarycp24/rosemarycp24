Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I have a planned leave for 5 days from November 20th to 24th. In addition, I would like to apply for leave from November 30th to December 8th (7 working days). I have discussed this with Gokul, but he suggested discussing it with you all as the change freeze starts from December 9th. Please let me know if it is okay to proceed with my plan.

Thank you for considering my application
