Hi Sijin,
It was a pleasure speaking with you. My family and I have decided to migrate to the US by the first week of June this year. My tenure with TCS over the past seven years has been exceptional. Given my circumstances, I wish to continue with TCS and am thus planning to request a transfer from TCS Australia to TCS US. I am willing to fully cooperate during this transition, including training a successor to ensure a seamless handover. I am looking to be released from CBA as soon as possible to avoid resigning, which is my last resort. I am prepared to upskill and dedicate the necessary time to train a replacement, ensuring no impact on billing. My tenure at TCS has been incredibly rewarding, prompting my preference for a transfer over resignation. Your assistance in this transfer would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your support so far.
Thanks & Regards, Rose
